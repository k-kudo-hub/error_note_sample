## What's Error Note? ü§î

![ErrorNote's logo](public/logo-large.png "logo")

Error Note was born for developers. A simple tool for recording daily errors and looking back at them later.

(In fact, Error Note was developed for my own use)

This may also contribute to people who are not good at document management.

## Plan for improvement üìé

#### Function to find your notes
The more notes you have, the harder it can be to find.We plan to add a search function limited to your notebook in the near future.

#### Markdown Notebook
Current notebooks cannot be decorated or paste the link. This is a serious problem.
We'll evolve for your better experience.

...and more
